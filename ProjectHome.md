Joshua is a chatbot for IRC written in perl. Based on the Markov chain and his self-learned database, he is able to (stometimes) say some smart stuff. Due to its algorythm, the bot is not bound to any language and can learn whatever dialect you speak in your IRC channel. Joshua is shipped with **no** database - after some time he is the complete result of what you and your mates made of him, so don't be too stupid.
